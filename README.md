# Aurora ‚Äî Sanctum Gateway Visualization Dashboard

Aurora is a dashboard that delivers real-time observability for transactions sent through Sanctum's Transaction Processing Gateway (TPG) on Solana. It streams transaction lifecycle updates, aggregates key KPIs, and offers a mockable benchmark mode to compare RPC, Jito, and Parallel routes.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

- **Live Transaction Feed** ‚Äî Real-time SSE stream with aurora glow animations, showing route, status, latency, and refund flags per signature.
- **Transaction Timeline** ‚Äî Interactive detail page with a submitted ‚Üí forwarded ‚Üí landed/failed ‚Üí refund timeline, slot metadata, and copy helpers.
- **Metrics & KPIs** ‚Äî Success rate, refund insight, p50/p95 confirmation latency, and average tip in SOL, auto-updated as events arrive.
- **Benchmark Mode** ‚Äî Synthetic (mock) batch runner to preview latency deltas across routes, paired with interactive charts and CSV export.
- **Aurora UI Theme** ‚Äî Dark glassmorphism, Space Grotesk + Inter typography, Framer Motion micro-animations, and gradient flourishes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create `.env.local`** (example values)
   ```env
   SANCTUM_API_KEY=sk_xxx
   AURORA_CLUSTER=devnet
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
   DEFAULT_JITO_TIP_LAMPORTS=50000
   MOCK_GATEWAY=true
   ```
   TPG calls use `https://tpg.sanctum.so/v1/{AURORA_CLUSTER}?apiKey=${SANCTUM_API_KEY}` with JSON-RPC methods such as `buildGatewayTransaction` and `sendTransaction`.

   A starter `.env.example` file is included for convenience.
3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the dashboard, `http://localhost:3000/benchmarks` for benchmark mode.

If you deploy on Vercel, the included `vercel.json` pins App Router functions to `@vercel/node@3.0.1` (Node.js 20) with a 60s limit, matching the PRD requirement to disable Edge.

### Mock vs Real Gateway

- When `MOCK_GATEWAY=true`, all `/api/tx/*` endpoints produce synthetic signatures and deterministic status progressions (1‚Äì3s), enabling UI testing without Solana access.
- Set `MOCK_GATEWAY=false` and provide a valid `SANCTUM_API_KEY` to send JSON-RPC requests to `https://tpg.sanctum.so/v1/{AURORA_CLUSTER}?apiKey=...`. Builder requests call `buildGatewayTransaction`, delivery uses `sendTransaction`, and status tracking relies on Solana `getSignatureStatuses` via `SOLANA_RPC_URL`.
- Refund markers are surfaced once Sanctum exposes them via the public feed; until then, the dashboard labels refund metrics as pending.

### Benchmarks

Benchmark mode currently runs against mocked data to visualise UX flows quickly. Hooks are in place to upgrade the runner to real Devnet transactions once signing/build payloads are available.

## üîå APIs & Streaming

- **TPG Builder & Delivery**: `app/api/tx/build` proxies `buildGatewayTransaction`, while `app/api/tx/send` forwards signed wire transactions to `sendTransaction` via `https://tpg.sanctum.so/v1/{cluster}?apiKey=...` (server-only).
- **Status Tracking**: the collector polls Solana RPC `getSignatureStatuses` (‚â§10 concurrent, ‚â•800‚ÄØms) to detect landed/failed signatures and timestamp confirmations.
- **SSE Stream**: `GET /api/stream` pushes `{ type, payload }` events for `transaction`, `metrics`, and `heartbeat`. The dashboard consumes it via `hooks/useAuroraStream`.
- **In-Memory Metrics**: `transactionCollector` and `lib/metrics` aggregate success, latency, and refund insight snapshots. For distributed deployments, plug in Redis pub/sub.

## üß≠ Future Enhancements

- Persist transaction history and metrics in Redis or a database for multi-instance deployments.
- Backfill transaction detail page directly from the Gateway when the collector misses a signature.
- Elevate benchmark mode to execute real Devnet batches using signed payloads.
- Add Slack/Discord hooks and per-API-key filters (outlined in PRD roadmap).
